This is a documentation for simple vector mockups sourced from Figma community. These are then modified to be used in React as JSX components.

Every mockup is a separate component and can be used in any React project. The components are designed to be as simple as possible to allow for easy customization.

This project uses 'philosophy' of ShadCn of owning the code and components. This means that you can use these components in your projects without any restrictions. You can also modify them as per your requirements.

Just like the original mockups, these components are also free to use and modify. You can use them in any project, commercial or personal.

## How to use?

To use these components, you can simply copy the code from the documentation and paste it in your project. You can also download the components from the GitHub repository.

You can customize the components by changing the colors, sizes, and other properties.

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

To use these components, you need to have a basic understanding of React and JSX. You should also be familiar with CSS and styling in React.

If you are new to React, you can start by reading the official React documentation. You can also take a look at the React tutorials on the internet.

You may also need to have a basic understanding of SVG and how to use it in React.
