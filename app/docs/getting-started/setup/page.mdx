# Setup

To use this project, you don't need any special setup or installation. You just
need a React project setup or any React framework like NextJS. It's recommended
to have a separate folder for components where you can save the mockup's
component file.

<ImageCaption>Example project dir structure</ImageCaption>

As already mentioned there is no need to set up your project to make it work it
with this project. Also mentioned it is highly advised to have a
**_components_** folder or something like **_mockupComponents_** for easy usage
and management.

You will create a new file called **_nameOfMockup.tsx_** or
**_nameOfMockup.jsx_** for every mockup you use in your project call the
function inside of it where needed.
