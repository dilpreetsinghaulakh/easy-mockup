# Usage

<Image
  src="/docs-usage.webp"
  className="w-full h-auto rounded-xl border border-text-primary/10 mb-0"
  alt="Intro image"
  width={2160}
  height={960}
/>
<ImageCaption>Importing mockup component</ImageCaption>

After creating the component you can use mockups wherever you want. You can put
anything in them or even animate them (kind of). It can be as simple as an image
or as complex as changing elements inside using scroll position. Possibilities
are endless, it's up to your needs/creativity to use these components.

## ❗️ Limitation - Please read!

These components use **_&lt;foreignObject&gt;_** svg element to put dom elements
inside screen of mockups. This makes them as compatible as foreignObject element
itself, meaning that their functionality is directly dependent on the level of
support that different browsers and environments provide for this SVG feature.

For example, animations inside of foreignObject breaks them in Safari browser.

In Safari using foreignObject with any of these properties will yield in
unexpected behavior.

- position
- webkit-transform-style
- webkit-backface-visibility
- transition
- transform
- calc (The calculation result may not conform to the expectation)
- opacity

This is well known issue and not limited to this project,
[read more](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75445782).

You can circumvent these issues by checking your site on various browsers and if
there are any issues then either don't use the properties which are causing
problems at all or block them from running on the browser(s) which have problems.

If you have any other way to avoid these issues please let me know.
